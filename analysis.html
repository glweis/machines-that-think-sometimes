    <h1>Analysis</h1>
    <p>Let's begin with graph analysis.</p>
    <p>Stuff about types, color, class.</p>

    <p>These are two of the graphs that look a lot like the previously mentioned Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. Based on the first graph, the lower ranked star types tend to have a higher magnitude, and the higher ranked star types tend to have a higher magnitude. The lowest and highest ranked star types also appear to have the lowest temperatures. There is a middle streak, or “main sequence” that appears to include the middle ranked star types. Looking at the second graph, M class stars appear to have either a very high magnitude or a very low one, and the lowest of the star temperatures. O class stars are varied in temperature but tend to have a consistently low magnitude. B class stars generally have medium temperatures, but vary across magnitudes. These are the main bunches and patterns that can be observed, but it is easy to see groupings amongst the types.</p>

    <p>For the above graphs, I created a new dataset of summary statistics for each star color. It held the mean of each variable per color group. Then, I compared the means of each variable across variables. Beginning with the star color vs. temperature graph, it can be observed that starting with the highest average temperature and moving to the lowest, stars are ranked as follows: blue, blue-white, white, yellow, orange, red. For star color vs. luminosity, they are ranked from highest average luminosity to lowest as orange, blue, white, blue-white, red, and yellow. For star color vs. radius, they are ranked from highest average radius to lowest as orange, red, white, blue, blue-white, and yellow. Lastly, in the graph depicting star color vs. magnitude, they are ranked from highest average magnitude to lowest as red, yellow, white, blue-white, blue, and orange.</p>

    <p>This paired matrix depicts a color coded point for each group of stars based on their star color. It uses the same dataset of means as the previous three graphs, setting the variable mean of a group of stars (based on star color) against other groups of stars. The second graph is a close up example of one of the pairs; on average, orange stars appear to have the highest luminosity and the lowest temperature compared to the other star color groups.</p>

    <p>This is a plotly version of some of my visualizations. If you observe the plots, some seem to follow the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram. There are also many bunches of stars based on spectral class.</p>
