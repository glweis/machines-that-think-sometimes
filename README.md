# Stellar Classification with Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis

**Significance:** Predictive models and statistical tests are beneficial for understanding stellar evolution and doing astrophysical research. By finding correlations between star characteristics and types, it can make it easier for scientists to gain insight into stellar life cycles, identify relationships between different stars and their environments, and classify large amounts of stars quickly instead of slowly and manually. This is especially important because of the extensive amounts of stellar data, much of which is difficult to handle without access to high-scale computational abilities.

**Data Source:** I am using a kaggle dataset of 240 star observations to conduct my statistical tests and create my models. According to the authors, the dataset is meant to prove that stars follow the Hertzsprung-Russell Diagram (HR-Diagram) so that we can classify stars by plotting its features based on the model. Though 240 observations is a lot, Iâ€™m not sure it will be enough, and I may end up using other similar datasets with the same variables to test and/or create my models.

Here are some links to other similar datasets that I may or may not end up using: Star Type Classification / NASA (kaggle.com), Star Dataset for Stellar Classification (kaggle.com)
